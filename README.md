# CubeNet

Can we create a neural net architecture that solves a Rubik's Cube?

The current goal is to solve a 2x2x2, but with more complex networks or perhaps Deep Reinforcement Learning, we
may be able to scale to a 3x3x3.

For reference, a 2x2x2 has "only" **3.5 million** states. A 3x3x3 **43 quintillion (43E18)** states.
